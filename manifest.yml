        3. Structure your response as follows:
           - Response should be in JSON format. Json should have "documents" field. "documents" field should have "id" and "keywords" fields. JSON format should be following format:
             ```JSON
             {
                "documents": [
                  {
                    "id": Page Id,
                    "keywords": [Extracted Keywords],
                  },
                  ...
